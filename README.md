# SieGraph
## This project is created to easily and user-friendly visualize the CSV archives created in Siemens HMI panels.

> HMI (Human-Machine Interface) is a device or software in industrial automation that is designed to display and control the production process. Through them, operators interact with the logic of an industrial controller. 
> Siemens HMI allows you to create CSV archives on a memory card or USB stick. This is very useful if you want to store data in non-volatile memory. But if you transfer it to a PC, you get a file with thousands of lines. 

### Unfortunately, Siemens does not provide any software that can display the CSV archive tags as graphs. Many Siemens panel users face this problem, and it leaves them puzzled. <br> So I decided to create an application that would simply and quickly turn a CSV archive file into a simple visualisation, in which the archive is displayed as a set of graphs of each individual tag.

### Technologies:
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
- [GraphJS](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### P.S. If you don't have the csv archive from the Siemens Comfort panel. You can test the functionality by taking the archive file from the test_csv_archives folder. :+1:
